# gg_site

Greg's Games is a fictitious site made for a JavaScript course. It contains various games, uses cookies to set light/dark mode, and implements a responsive design with a mobile menu. This was a nice exercise in learning how to implement cookies, closure functions, and using JS to enhance site interactivity.

### Don't want to download a bunch of files to see how the site looks?

Here are some sample images from the actual site:

Desktop site with dark mode enabled
<img src="demo_img1.png" alt="Image of game page on desktop, dark mode enabled" width="750"/>


Game page on mobile with default light mode enabled
<img src="demo_img2.png" alt="Image of Hive and Seek game on mobile, light mode enabled" width="500"/>


Game page on mobile with dark mode enabled
<img src="demo_img3.png" alt="Image of Hive and Seek game on mobile, dark mode enabled" width="500"/>
