Greg's Games is a fictitious site made for a JavaScript course. It contains various games, uses cookies to set light/dark mode, and implements a responsive design with a mobile menu. This was a nice exercise in learning how to implement cookies, closure functions, and using JS to enhance site interactivity.

###Don't want to download a bunch of files to see how the site looks?

Here are some sample images from the actual site.
